# Sample doc

This file is here so you have something to open after starting MD-Easy.

- **Plans** — put project plans here
- **Documentation** — any `.md` files under `DOC_ROOT` show up in the sidebar
- **Agent output** — agents can write `.md` here and call `POST /refresh` so the view updates

Your place (this file and scroll) is kept when the UI refreshes, unless this file is removed.
